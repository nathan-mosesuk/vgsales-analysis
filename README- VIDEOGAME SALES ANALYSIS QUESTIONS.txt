VIDEO GAME SALES ANALYSIS

==============================

Skills:

SQL
Python
Matplotlib
Seaborn
numpy
Tableau
Excel

==============================

Description: Data analysis of the videogame sales, using the
questions are provided in kaggle.com as guide. To answer each question, a python script
was used to retrieve the information from the sqlite database created and plot the 
results with Seaborn (matplotlib) and save them into a txt file as well.
The sqlite relational database (created in the previous step using the cleaned Excel 
csv file) will be used as data source to analyze the data and answer the questions.
Results will be also plotted in Tableau using the cleaned csv Excel file as source.

Note: each question was answered using a separate python code for each one, but all
questions could have been answered all together in one python code. For practicity,
separace scripts were done, to keep the scripts simple and short.
